#About
This is a very basic two-question quiz app. The user has 60 seconds to complete the quiz. Once completed, the user receives a score equal to the seconds left on the timer. They can then enter their name, which gets logged to local storage, and is displayed alongside other scores added from previous gameplay stored in local storage.

#Purpose
The purpose of creating this app was to demonstrate the ability in using the setInterval() method, writing code that interacts with the DOM, creating events using eventListener, and storing and retrieving data from local storage. 

#NOTES as of 2.21.2023
- I know the styling is very basic right now, and I would like to add more questions. With the limiited time I had, I focused purely on JavaScript functionality. If I have time I will add more CSS and questions later.
- I know the app needs to indicate to the player they are incorrect when they click on a wrong answer, and also that they are correct when they answer a question correctly. If I have time I will do this.
